# Image-Classification-with-CNN-using-Keras
Used CNN model to classify images on the popular CIFAR-10 dataset
The CIFAR 10 datset images were preprocessed and a CNN model built which used conv layers.pooling layers,Batch Normalization,Dropout Regularization and Keras multiple callbacks such as EarlyStopping implemented to avoid overfitting and underfitting and model saving callbacks,further the results were visualized,
